## My process
- Utilized Flexbox on the "body" element to vertically and horizontally center the QR code wrapper
- Used custom properties (for the first time) to set colors and font-family
- Referenced design JPG images for spacing and sizing reference


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
- With this small project, I wanted to practice using flexbox for the layout and use custom properties for the first time


### Continued development
- HTML could be more semantic/descriptive. Could refactor any pixel values to rem units; I do want to study up on the benefits and use cases of relative units over pixels.
